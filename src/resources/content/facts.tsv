There are currently 3 active craft on Mars: Curiosity rover (NASA), Perseverance rover (NASA), and Ingenuity copter (NASA).
There are currently 7 active craft in orbit round Mars: Mars Odyssey (NASA), Mars Express (ESA), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (NASA), MAVEN (NASA), ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (ESA), Hope (MBRSC) and, Tianwen-1 (CNSA).
There's a low energy launch window for Mars every two years and two months (Earth time). There's also a minimum lowest energy cycle every 16 Earth years.
During the Nov 2013 launch window, 2 missions were launched: MAVEN (NASA), and Mars Orbiter Mission (ISRO).
During the March 2016 launch window, only 1 mission was launched: ExoMars TGO (NASA).
During the May 2018 launch window, only 1 mission was launched: InSight (NASA)
During the Jul-Sep 2020 launch window 3 missions were launched: Mars Hope orbiter (MBRSC), Tianwen-1 with the Zhurong rover (CNSA), and Mars 2020 Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter (NASA).
There were no missions to Mars launched in the Aug-Nov 2022 launch window.
Curiosity rover is powered by a 4.8kg radioisotope pellet of plutonium-238 dioxide. This generates 100 watts of electricity and 2000 watts of heat that is used to warm Curiosity's outer components.
Curiosity rover has patterned wheels to maintain traction. The pattern left in the sand is used by on-board cameras to estimate the distance traveled. The pattern itself is Morse code for "JPL" (.--- .--. .-..).
Curiosity rover touched down in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012. The spot has been named Bradbury landing, for Ray Bradbury, author of Fahrenheit 451 and the Martian Chronicles who had died on June 5, 2012.
O, Thomas, will a Race one day stand really tall|Across the Void, across the Universe and all?|And, measured out with rocket fire,|At last put Adam's finger forth|As on the Sistine Ceiling,|And God's hand come down the other way|To measure man and find him Good|And Gift him with Forever's Day?|I work for that|>- Ray Bradbury, If Only We Had Taller Been
Short man, Large dream|I send my rockets forth between my ears|Hoping an inch of Good is worth a pound of years|Aching to hear a voice cry back along the universal mall:|We've reached Alpha Centauri!|We're tall, O God, we're tall!|>- Ray Bradbury, If Only We Had Taller Been
In Sanskrit the planet Mars is personified as the deity Mangala. He also goes by the title Lohita ('the red one'). Like his Roman counterpart, he presides over Tuesday.
The alchemical symbol for the planet Mars is a stylised spear and shield representing the Mars the Roman god of war. It came to to represent the male gender through the works of Linnaeus.

A Mars sol is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35 seconds. A year is 687 sols, about 1 year and 320 days on Earth.
Mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system after Mercury. Its mass is equivalent to 0.107 Earths and gravity is 38% of Earth.
Mars orbits at a distance of between 1.3 to 1.6 AU, around 206 to 259 million km.
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They're 22km and 12km in diameter respectively. Both satellites were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall.
Phobos has an orbital period of 7.6 hours. From the surface, Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. It appears about a third of the size of Earths moon. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit (where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation) rises as expected in the east, but slowly, taking about 2.7 days to set. It would appear slightly larger than Venus does from Earth.
The ice-filled Korolev crater near Mars's north pole is estimated to hold about 2,200km3.
The total elevation change of Olympus Mons from the northwest plains to its summit is almost 26km, roughly 3 times the height of Mount Everest.
The intensity of meteor showers is given as Zenithal Hourly Rate (ZHR). This is the number of meteors you would see under perfect conditions with the shower coming from directly overhead.
The Darian calendar has 24 months of 28 days each (except every 6th which has 27). The months are named for the constellations of the zodiac, alternately in Latin and Sanskrit.
The constellation of Sagittarius takes its name from the Latin for archer. The Sanskrit counterpart in Dhanus meaning bow. They are used as the 1st and 2nd months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Capricorn takes its name from the Latin for goat's horn. The Sanskrit counterpart, Makara, refers to a sea-monster, sometimes depicted as a crocodile. They are used as the 3rd and 4th months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Aquarius takes its name from the Latin for water-carrier. The Sanskrit counterpart is Kumbha, a type of pot used for water. They are used as the 5th and 6th months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Pisces takes its name from the Latin for fish. The Sanskrit counterpart, Mina, has the same meaning. They are used as the names of the 7th and 8th months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Aries takes its name from the Latin for ram. The Sanskrit counterpart is Mesha meaning sheep. They are used as the names of the 9th and 10th months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Taurus takes its name from the Latin for bull. The Sanskrit counterpart, Rishabha, has the same meaning. They are used as the 11th and 12 months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Gemini takes its name from the Latin for twins. The Sanskrit counterpart is Mithuna meaning paired. They are used as the 13th and 14th months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Cancer takes its name from the Latin for crab. The Sanskrit counterpart, Karka, has the same meaning. They are used as the 15th and 16th months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Leo takes its name from the Latin for lion. The Sanskrit counterpart, Simha, has the same meaning. They are used as the 17th and 18th months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Virgo takes its name from the Latin for maiden. The Sanskrit counterpart, Kanya, has the same meaning. They are used as the 19th and 20th months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Libra takes its name from the Latin for scales. The Sanskrit counterpart, Tula, has the same meaning. They are used as the 21st and 22nd months of the Darian calendar.
The constellation of Scorpius takes its name from the Latin for scorpion. The Sanskrit counterpart, Vrishika, has the same meaning. They are used as the 23rd and 24th months of the Darian calendar.
The Darian calendar uses the 'telescopic epoch' as year 0, approx 12 March 1609, as this was the year Johannes Kepler published "Astronomia Nova". It has the advantage that all historic observations of Mars occur in positive dates.
NASA uses the Mars Sol Date (MSD), a count of sols since the Julian date 29 Dec 1873 as a date prior to the 1877 perihelic opposition (when Mars is at its closest approach to the sun and aligned with Earth).
